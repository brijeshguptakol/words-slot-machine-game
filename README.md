# words-slot-machine-game

This is a game - a bit like a slot machine. There are 7 reels in total and each reel is made up of various characters. These characters are ​not​ random but are in a set sequence that doesn’t change.

```
u d x c l a e
e y v p q y n
i l o w m g n
a n d i s e v
a n j a e t b
a b w t d o h
```

If the player were to play the word ​BAT​. Then the corressponding 3 reels will move down to the next letter and all each letter that was used will move back to the top of the reel to be re-used. Also, in this case, the player will earn some points as determined by the weight of each character which will be supplied seperately.
